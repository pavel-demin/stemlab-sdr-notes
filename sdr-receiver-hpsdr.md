Introduction
-----

This version of the SDR receiver emulates two [Hermes](http://openhpsdr.org/hermes.php) modules with eight receivers. It may be useful for projects that require sixteen receivers compatible with the programs that support the HPSDR/Metis communication protocol.

The HPSDR/Metis communication protocol is described in the following documents:

 - [Metis - How it works](https://github.com/TAPR/OpenHPSDR-SVN/raw/master/Metis/Documentation/Metis- How it works_V1.33.pdf)

 - [HPSDR - USB Data Protocol](https://github.com/TAPR/OpenHPSDR-SVN/raw/master/Documentation/USB_protocol_V1.58.doc)

Hardware
-----

The FPGA configuration consists of sixteen identical digital down-converters (DDC). Their structure is shown on the following diagram:

![HPSDR receiver]({{ "/img/sdr-transceiver-hpsdr-ddc.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})

The I/Q data rate is configurable and four settings are available: 48, 96, 192, 384 kSPS.

The tunable frequency range covers from 0 Hz to 61.44 MHz.

The [projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr](https://github.com/pavel-demin/stemlab-sdr-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr) directory contains two Tcl files: [block_design.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/stemlab-sdr-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/block_design.tcl), [rx.tcl](https://github.com/pavel-demin/stemlab-sdr-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/rx.tcl). The code in these files instantiates, configures and interconnects all the needed IP cores.

The [projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/filters](https://github.com/pavel-demin/stemlab-sdr-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/filters) directory contains the source code of the [R](http://www.r-project.org) scripts used to calculate the coefficients of the FIR filters.

The [projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/server](https://github.com/pavel-demin/stemlab-sdr-notes/tree/master/projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/server) directory contains the source code of the UDP server ([sdr-receiver-hpsdr.c](https://github.com/pavel-demin/stemlab-sdr-notes/blob/master/projects/sdr_receiver_hpsdr/server/sdr-receiver-hpsdr.c)) that receives control commands and transmits the I/Q data streams to the SDR programs.

Software
-----

This SDR receiver should work with most of the programs that support the HPSDR/Metis communication protocol:

 - [PowerSDR mRX PS](http://openhpsdr.org/wiki/index.php?title=PowerSDR) that can be downloaded from [this link](https://github.com/TAPR/OpenHPSDR-PowerSDR/releases)

 - [QUISK](http://james.ahlstrom.name/quisk) with the `hermes/quisk_conf.py` configuration file

 - [CW Skimmer Server](http://dxatlas.com/skimserver) and [RTTY Skimmer Server](http://dxatlas.com/RttySkimServ)

 - [ghpsdr3-alex](http://napan.ca/ghpsdr3) client-server distributed system

 - [openHPSDR Android Application](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.g0orx.openhpsdr) that is described in more details at [this link](http://g0orx.blogspot.be/2015/01/openhpsdr-android-application.html)

 - [Java desktop application](http://g0orx.blogspot.co.uk/2015/04/java-desktop-application-based-on.html) based on openHPSDR Android Application

Getting started
-----

 - Download [SD card image zip file]({{ site.release-image }}) (more details about the SD card image can be found at [this link]({{ "/alpine/" | prepend: site.baseurl }})).
 - Copy the content of the SD card image zip file to an SD card.
 - Optionally, to start the application automatically at boot time, copy its `start.sh` file from `apps/sdr_receiver_hpsdr` to the topmost directory on the SD card.
 - Insert the SD card in STEMlab SDR and connect the power.
 - Install and run one of the HPSDR programs.

Running CW Skimmer Server and Reverse Beacon Network Aggregator
-----

 - Install [CW Skimmer Server](http://dxatlas.com/skimserver).
 - Copy [HermesIntf.dll](https://github.com/k3it/HermesIntf/releases) to the CW Skimmer Server program directory (C:\Program Files (x86)\Afreet\SkimSrv).
 - In the `SkimSrv` directory, rename `HermesIntf.dll` to `HermestIntf_XXXX.dll` where `XXXX` are the last four digits of the MAC address of the STEMlab SDR.
 - Make a copy of the `SkimSrv` directory and rename the copy to `SkimSrv2`.
 - In the `SkimSrv2` directory, rename `SkimSrv.exe` to `SkimSrv2.exe` and rename `HermestIntf_XXXX.dll` to `HermestIntf_FFXX.dll`.
 - Install [Reverse Beacon Network Aggregator](http://www.reversebeacon.net/pages/Aggregator+34).
 - Start `SkimSrv.exe` and `SkimSrv2.exe`, configure frequencies and your call sign.
 - Start Reverse Beacon Network Aggregator.
